download a data set and put it in the folder data/original
the folder structure should be as following: mnist/class1
                                                  /class2
                                                  /class3
                                                  ...
we used the mnist and the fids30
you can download the mnist dataset from the following source:
https://www.kaggle.com/scolianni/mnistasjpg

we will provide you with a sample
                                                  
the project was tested on python version 3.6.9
installation:                                            
pip install -r requirements.txt
change the working directory of the main.py to be the projects root and set the src folder to contain the project's sources

execute

python main.py -d mnist

to start the whole pipeline of the project for the mnist dataset, which should be located in data/original/mnist

you can also start only one sub process, which are defined as following:
'pre' for splitting the data, 'train' to train the GAN, 'gen' to generate synthetic images, and 'eval' to start the evaluation process

e.g. execute

python main.py -d mnist -m pre

to start preprocessing on the mnist dataset

there is also a config file located in src/config.py where you can adjust the most important parameters
